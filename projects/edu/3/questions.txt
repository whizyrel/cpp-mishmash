Write a C++ application that will use UTME score, LASU score and WAEC to
determine if a student will be given admission into computer science.
Note that aggregate is normally computed from UTME score, LASU scores and WAEC result.
Assuming that the cut off mark for Computer Science is 52%, test your program with
the scores of 100 students. Your application must be able to read input from files and
give output as a file.

Aggregate = 0.0625 * UME score + 0.50 * GCE - O/L score + 0.50 * post–UME score

Where the maximum scores obtainable from UME and post-UME are 400 and 50
respectively.

The O/L point is obtained from the five best relevant subjects to
the choice of course of the candidate using equation 2.
O/L score = Total O/L point + Sitting point

Where the Total O/L point is computed by converting the students grade in each subject to
points using C6 = 3, C5 = 4, C4 = 5, B3 (A3) = 6, B2 (A2) = 7, A1 = 8 and the
sitting point is awarded based on the number of times the candidate sat the
O/L examination to pass the five relevant subjects, the maximum allowed
number of sitting is 2.

One sitting attracts 10 points and 2 sittings attract 5
points.

Note that in Nigeria the O/L grading system uses the scale 40% – 49%
= C6, 50% – 59% = C5, 60% – 69% = C4, 70% – 79% = A3, 80% – 89% = A2
and 90% – 100% = A1
